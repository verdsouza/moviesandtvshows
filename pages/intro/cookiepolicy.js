              <p style={{ color: "#666", marginBottom: "24px" }}>
                As is common practice with nearly all professional websites,
                this site uses cookies, which are small files downloaded to your
                computer, to enhance your browsing experience. This page
                explains the information they collect, their purpose, and why we
                occasionally need to store these cookies. We'll also outline how
                you can prevent these cookies from being stored, though this
                might result in the reduction or disruption of certain site
                features.
              </p>

              <h2 style={headingStyle}>How We Use Cookies</h2>
              <p style={{ color: "#666", marginBottom: "24px" }}>
                We employ cookies for various purposes as detailed below.
                Unfortunately, in most cases, there are no universally accepted
                industry settings to disable cookies without entirely
                sacrificing the functionality and features they contribute to
                the site. It is advisable to keep all cookies enabled unless you
                are unsure whether they are necessary, in case they are used to
                provide a service you utilize.
              </p>

              <h2 style={headingStyle}>Disabling Cookies</h2>
              <p style={{ color: "#666", marginBottom: "24px" }}>
                You have the option to prevent cookies from being set by
                adjusting your browser settings (consult your browser's Help
                section for guidance). Be aware that disabling cookies will
                impact the functionality of this site, along with many other
                websites you visit. This usually involves the deactivation of
                certain features and functionalities on this site. Thus, it is
                recommended that you do not disable cookies.
              </p>
